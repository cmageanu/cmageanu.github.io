# Predicting Stock Prices - DSND Capstone project

This work is part of a Data Science Nanodegree at [Udacity](#itcp). It is an attempt to implement a stock predictor.

## Project Definition

### Project Overview

From the very beginning let's make clear this work has nothing to do with any investment objective. At no time there is any attempt to asses any profit and loss function following the predictive model described here. As such, it must be seen just an oportunity to exercise a few data science tools and methods.

The overall objective of this project is to predict stock prices.

We employ a supervised learning approach where the features of the predicted value, Adjusted Close stock price (AC), are the AC values of the the same stock for the previous days.

We find that XGBoost and Random Forest regressors perform worse than a simple Linear regressor, while also taking abot 3 orders of magnitude more time to train a model.

We test a Linear regressor with 20 lagged values and find out that it performs on average within the objective +/- 5% relative error margin.

For testing we looked at a subset of the Nasdaq stocks with a market valuation of $1bn or more. This subset contains about 34% of the Nasdaq stock symbols, but make over 98% of the total Market Capitalisation of Nasdaq listed companies as of this date (December 2021). From this perspective we tested the predictor practically over the whole market.

### Problem Statement

The project's objective is to build a stock price predictor that takes daily trading data over a certain date range as input, and outputs projected estimates for given query dates.

Various metrics are available from market data suppliers. The predicted value needs to be the Adjusted Close (AC) field.

The proposed objective is to obtain an average relative percentage error of +/- 5% of the actual value AC for up to 7 days in the future.

Predicting stock prices is notoriously hard not least because they are known to contain a lot of randomness. [Random Walks](#random_walks) and [Brownian motion](#brownian_motion) have been used to model stock prices - both are techniques modelling random events.

Given the above, predicting stock prices seems to be a hard task.

On the other hand, long term average stock market return seems to be fairly stable at around 10%, as reported [here](#asr_1) and [here](#asr_2) for example.

A 10% growth averaged over about 250 trading days per year, gives us hope that, at least for stable stocks with relatively low volatility, predicting with +/- 5% precision for up to 7 days in the future is achievable. So let's see.

### Metrics

The project specification states one possible criteria as: predicted stock value 7 days out is within +/- 5% of actual value, on average. So we will try to optimise the predictor against the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The MAPE of our predicted values 7 days out into the future should be less than 0.05.

## Data Exploration and Visualisation

We are using data from [Yahoo Finance](#yfinance) for which there is a python module, pandas_datareader which can extract data programatically for a given stock symbol.

We'll look at stock prices as a series of metric values, mainly AC values as we'll see below. So all the data processing and prediction will revolve around the AC values as a time series.

First, we'll define a function, get_symbol_data to retrieve the data from Yahoo Finance and store it on disk, if it has not been downloaded today.

Let's pick a symbol, say GOOG and and plot the the Adjusted Close field to try to make sense of the data:


```python
symbol = 'GOOG'
symbol_data = get_symbol_data(symbol)
```

A hint of short term randomness can be sensed by plotting the Adjusted Close values:


```python
symbol_data['Adj Close'].plot(figsize=(16,9))
```




    <AxesSubplot:xlabel='Date'>

Despite the apparent noise in the graph above, as we'll see, it turns out that GOOG is one of the more predictable stocks, for which the MAPE value of our predictor falls well under the 5% objective.

A note to say about the Yahoo Finance data is that it is very well formed with no missing data, so we don't have to do any data pre-processing

Plotting the autocorrelation matrix, suggests that only the Volume field may contain additional information. All other fields have a strong correlation with the Adjusted Close field and are likely to not improve a model that would include them as features.


```python
fig = plt.gcf()
fig.set_size_inches(16,6)
sns.heatmap(symbol_data.corr(), annot=True, fmt=".2f");
```


![png](output_11_0.png)


Another data set we'll use is a list of stock symbols from the [Nasdaq website.](#nasdaq_stock_symbols) downloaded into a file called symbols.csv.


```python
symbols_data = pd.read_csv('symbols.csv')
symbols_data = symbols_data.sort_values(['Market Cap'], ascending=[False])
symbols_data
```

We have a few null values on the Market Cap column, so let's drop them, and also sort this data set by Market Cap which will prove to be useful:


```python
symbols_data = symbols_data[symbols_data['Market Cap'].notna()].sort_values(['Market Cap'], ascending=[False])
len(symbols_data)
```




    7795



Where's wealth, the data is always skewed, so plotting the cummulative sum distribution of the (sorted data by) Market Cap leads us to observe the usual "80/20" rule, where a relatively few companies make up most of the market capital at Nasdaq.


```python
symbols_data.reset_index()['Market Cap'].cumsum().plot(figsize=(16,9), ylabel='Cumulative Market Cap tens of $tn', xlabel='Rank of companies ordered descending by Market Cap')
```




    <AxesSubplot:xlabel='Rank of companies ordered descending by Market Cap', ylabel='Cumulative Market Cap tens of $tn'>




![png](output_17_1.png)


Incidentally, the subset of companies with a market valuation of at least $1bn make more than 98% of the total market. We'll restrict our analysis to this subset which is a list of 2844 companies:


```python
len(symbols_data[symbols_data['Market Cap'] >= 1000000000])
```




    2844




```python
symbols_data[symbols_data['Market Cap'] >= 1000000000]['Market Cap'].sum() / symbols_data['Market Cap'].sum() 
```




    0.9831569804808304




```python
symbols_data = symbols_data[symbols_data['Market Cap'] >= 1000000000]
len(symbols_data)
```




    2844




```python
2844/8268
```




    0.3439767779390421



It turns out our 80/20 rule is more a 98/34 rule where about 34% of Nasdaq companies make up more than 98% of the Nasdaq market value.

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing

### Time series prediction approached with tabular regression

The basic idea of this methodology is to create features of our predicted field, ac, as previous temporal values of the same field, ac. Then we will be able to apply tabular regressors such as linear, random forest or XGBoost.

So the predicted future value y would be ac(t+1).

And the features X we'll use to predict y will be ac(t), ac(t-1), ... ac(t-k) - the k+1 previous values of the ac field.

Let's pick a symbol, say GOOG and prepare features for the Adjusted Close ac field as the previous values of the same time series of Adjusted Close values.

First, load the data and let's rename columns for easier coding:


```python
symbol = 'GOOG'
symbol_data = get_symbol_data(symbol)
symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})
```

Next we define a function which takes a dataframe as an input and returns a dataframe with additional lagged columns backwards and forwards as specified by the n_in (backward values) and n_out (forward values) parameters. This function is build on a concept described in this [article](#ts_as_supervised_learning)


```python
def df_to_lagged_features(df, n_in=1, n_out=0, dropnan=True):
    """
    Creates features for a data frame suitable for supervised learning.
    Arguments:
        df: Pandas dataframe.
        n_in: Number of lag observations as input (X).
        n_out: Number of observations as output (y).
        dropnan: Boolean whether or not to drop rows with NaN values.
    Returns:
        Pandas DataFrame of series with lagged columns backwards and forwards suitable for supervised learning.
    """

    lagged_columns, lagged_column_names = list(), list()
    df_column_names = df.columns
	# input sequence (t-n, ... t-1)
    for i in range(n_in, 0, -1):
        lagged_columns.append(df.shift(i))
        lagged_column_names += [('%s(t-%d)' % (column_name, i)) for column_name in df_column_names]

    # add current value (moment t)
    lagged_column_names += [ '%s(t)' % (column_name) for column_name in df_column_names]
    lagged_columns.append(df)
    
    # future moments if any (t+1, ... t+n)
    if n_out >= 1:
        for i in range(1, n_out+1):
            lagged_columns.append(df.shift(-i))
            lagged_column_names += [('%s(t+%d)' % (column_name, i)) for column_name in df_column_names]
    
    # put it all together
    agg = concat(lagged_columns, axis=1)
    agg.columns = lagged_column_names
    # drop rows with NaN values
    if dropnan:
        agg.dropna(inplace=True)
    return agg
```

Let's create features as shifted 'ac' column. How many lagged values should we choose is not an exact science. We mainly look at 7 predicted values in the future, so we may want to choose a multiple of this number as the number of past values to learn from, in the hope that we will catch any short term trend. Thus, we'll choose n_in=30 and n_out=7 for the moment:


```python
symbol_lag = df_to_lagged_features(symbol_data.loc[:, ['ac']], n_in=30, n_out=7)
symbol_lag
```

Let's now prepare y and X, the predicted values and the input for any model respectively.

y would be the 7 values of the 'ac' column ac(t+1)..ac(t+7)

X would be all other columns from ac(t-30) until ac(t), so in fact we'll have 31 features to use in predicting y.


```python
n_out = 7
y_columns = [ 'ac(t+{0})'.format(i) for i in range(1, n_out+1) ]
X = symbol_lag.drop(y_columns, axis=1)
y = symbol_lag.drop(X.columns, 1)
```


```python
y.head()
```

We are now ready to dive in and apply some tabular machine learning algorithms. So:

### Implementation

#### Small detour on a wrong path.

Lets create train and test data sets then apply some tabular algos using the MultiOutputRegressor to predict the multiple values of y at the same time.

The mean_absolute_percentage_error is the output metric we are interested in:


```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
```


```python
%%time

model = LinearRegression(normalize=True)
model = MultiOutputRegressor(model)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(mape)
```

    0.02589295842720629
    CPU times: user 142 ms, sys: 119 Âµs, total: 142 ms
    Wall time: 26.2 ms


Great! At 2.5% we are under the target value of 5%. Can Random Forest or XGBoost improve the outcome?


```python
%%time

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
model = MultiOutputRegressor(model)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(mape)
```

    0.020769880120701485
    CPU times: user 30 s, sys: 16 ms, total: 30.1 s
    Wall time: 30.1 s



```python
%%time

model = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05)
model = MultiOutputRegressor(model)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(mape)
```

    0.02160753428438072
    CPU times: user 10min 2s, sys: 12.3 s, total: 10min 15s
    Wall time: 45.4 s


Both Random Forest and XGB improve on the linear regressor result, so it seems we have a solution - an easy one!

Sadly, this is not the case. The reason for this is that beacause of the lagged features, data from the test set appears in the training set, so to some extent we use the same data for training and testing - a sure recipe for overfitting.

#### Back on the right track now.

Let's try again, this time selecting the test set at the end of the time series, and ensuring there is no overlap between the training set and the testing set.


```python
n_in = 30
n_out = 7
test_size = n_out

Different story, right? The linear model still gives a good result with a 2% relative error, but both the Random Forest and XGB regressors have worse results. 

In addition, these algos seem to take orders of magnitudes more time to train than the linear model. We have run quite a number of time consuming experiments, which we are not going to present here. In all these experiments, the linear model produced better outcomes and usable runtimes.

The end result is that, from now onwards we will only use the linear regressor.

A small note to say, that, although not presented here, we also tested the RegressorChain of the sklearn.multioutput module. It consistently produces worse results than the MultiOutputRegressor, presumably because the errors produced in the first predicted values (say ac(t+1)), which are used to predict next values (ac(t+2) etc) in the chain, amplify the errors in the predicted values down the chain. So, we are only using the MultiOutputRegressor to predict multiple values in the future.

### Refinement

The following function will compute the mean percentage error for a linear model for a given data set and back and forth lagged values:


```python
%%time

def make_mape(df, n_in, n_out, model='linear'):
    """
    Computes the mean absolute percentage error of a linear model fit over df['ac'] time series with n_in + 1 history values, and n_out predicted values
    Arguments:
        df: Pandas dataframe which should include the Adjuste Close 'ac' column
        n_in: Number of lag observations as input (X).
        n_out: Number of observations as output (y).
    Returns:
        Mean absolute percentage error of the linear model fit to the observations
    """
    
    # create lagged features
    dflag = df_to_lagged_features(df.loc[:, ['ac']], n_in=n_in, n_out=n_out)

    # drop columns ac(t+1)..ac(t+2) from dflag to create X features
    columns_to_drop = [ 'ac(t+{0})'.format(i) for i in range(1, n_out+1) ]
    X = dflag.drop(columns_to_drop, 1)

    # predicted values are all non X columns
    y = dflag.drop(X.columns, 1)

    # create test/train datasets
    test_size = n_out

    not_for_train_size = n_out + n_in + test_size

    X_train = X.iloc[:len(X)-not_for_train_size]
    X_test = X.iloc[-test_size:]

    y_train = y.iloc[:len(y)-not_for_train_size]
    y_test = y.iloc[-test_size:]

    # fit and predict a multiclass linear model
    model = LinearRegression(normalize=True)
    model = MultiOutputRegressor(model)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)

    return mape
```

#### One model or many models?

Intuitively, this is easy to answer: one model for all market symbols will likely average among all stocks. It might be a good model for the average market and a few stocks that really move the market, but otherwise it would probably fair poorly on most of the stocks.

Let's further enforce this (weak) justification by looking at the data of a few stocks.

Let's load the data and plot the Adjusted Close value for the last 6 years for a few stocks:

We'll pick the first, the 10th, the 100th and 1000th stock symbols by market capitalisation:


```python
ranks = [0, 9, 99, 999]
symbols = [ symbols_data.iloc[r]['Symbol'] for r in ranks ]
symbols
```




    ['AAPL', 'JPM', 'MRNA', 'DAVA']




```python
dframes = []
for s in symbols:
    s_data = get_symbol_data(s, start_date='2016-01-01')
    s_data = s_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':s})
    dframes.append(s_data[s])

ticks = pd.concat(dframes, axis=1)
ticks
```

Looking at the above plot, it is reasonable to suspect a linear model will perform poorly on the MRNA stock, let alone a combination of the four.

This is a weak, informal justification for this decision, but we'll generate one model per stock. The training time is well under a second per stock so, we'll be able to generate the respective model(s) in a reasonable time.

#### How much lagged data do we need?

Let's look at a couple of companies, GOOG, TSLA and see if we can generalise what we'll learn. At a glance it is hard to say whether one stock or the other will fare better with our linear regressor:


```python
symbols = ['GOOG', 'TSLA']
dframes = []
for s in symbols:
    s_data = get_symbol_data(s, '2016-01-01')
    s_data = s_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':s})
    dframes.append(s_data[s])

ticks = pd.concat(dframes, axis=1)

ticks.plot(figsize=(16,9))
```




    <AxesSubplot:xlabel='Date'>




![png](output_56_1.png)


Next, we set the predicted values n_out to 7, while we fit linear regressors for different training sets where the training sets have back values as features ranging from 1 to 60. We then plot the mean percentage errors (y axis) versus the number of lagged features in the model (X axis) for both TSLA and GOOG:


```python
%%time
symbols = ['GOOG', 'TSLA']
mape_records = list()

for s in symbols:
    symbol_data = get_symbol_data(s)
    symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})
    mape_list = []
    for n_in in range(1, 61):
        mape_list.append(make_mape(symbol_data, n_in, n_out=7))
    mape_records.append(mape_list)

df1 = pd.DataFrame.from_records(mape_records).transpose()
df1.columns = symbols
df1.plot(figsize=(16,9), xlabel='Number of lagged features', ylabel='MAPE for a multioutput linear model predicting 7 values ahead')
```

    CPU times: user 25.2 s, sys: 516 ms, total: 25.7 s
    Wall time: 3.23 s





    <AxesSubplot:xlabel='Number of lagged features', ylabel='MAPE for a multioutput linear model predicting 7 values ahead'>




![png](output_58_2.png)


Looking at the graph above there seems to be no benefit of retaining more than 20 lagged values for our linear regressor. Plotting GOOG and TSLA separately makes it more clear.


```python
%%time
symbol_data = get_symbol_data('GOOG')
symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})

mape_list = []

for n_in in range(1, 61):
    mape_list.append(make_mape(symbol_data, n_in, n_out=7))

pd.DataFrame(mape_list).rename(columns={0:'GOOG'}).plot(figsize=(16,9), xlabel='Number of lagged features', ylabel='MAPE for a multioutput linear model predicting 7 values ahead')
```

mape_list = []

for n_in in range(1, 60):
    mape_list.append(make_mape(symbol_data, n_in, n_out=7))

pd.DataFrame(mape_list).rename(columns={0:'TSLA'}).plot(figsize=(16,9), xlabel='Number of lagged features', ylabel='MAPE for a multioutput linear model predicting 7 values ahead')
```

![png](output_61_2.png)


So we think of retaining no more than 20 lagged features for our linear regressor. Let's see if this assuption holds for 10 random stocks from our symbols_data.

For replicability of this notebook, we use "random.seed(313)" in all code below where a random process is used.


```python
random.seed(313)
symbols = random.sample(symbols_data['Symbol'].to_list(), 10)
symbols
```




    ['RDWR', 'ARGX', 'FLNG', 'VALN', 'ALHC', 'BBL', 'LII', 'FANG', 'INFO', 'FOCS']




```python
%%time
mape_records = []
for symbol in symbols:
    symbol_data = get_symbol_data(symbol)
    symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})
    mape_list = []
    for n_in in range(1, 60):
        try:
            mape_list.append(make_mape(symbol_data, n_in, n_out=7))
        except:
            # we don't catch this exception as it is generated when there is not enough data to derive the lagged history features
            continue
    mape_records.append(mape_list)
```

    CPU times: user 1min 50s, sys: 2.33 s, total: 1min 52s
    Wall time: 14.1 s



```python
df1 = pd.DataFrame.from_records(mape_records).transpose()
df1.columns = symbols
df1.plot(figsize=(16,9), xlabel='Number of lagged features', ylabel='MAPE for a multioutput linear model predicting 7 values ahead')
```




    <AxesSubplot:xlabel='Number of lagged features', ylabel='MAPE for a multioutput linear model predicting 7 values ahead'>




![png](output_65_1.png)


The above plot still sustains our 20 lagged features approach. But, let's do further tests in support for this decision:

## Results
### Model Evaluation and Validation

#### How much train data do we need?

Here, again, we try to compromise between two facts of intuition:

On one hand, on stocks having a clear trand we would likely want a long time series to capture the long trend.

On the other hand, irregular noisy time series will extract little information from a long time series.

So far we used all the data history from yahoo which of course has different lenghts for different stocks.

To further evaluate and validate our linear model, let's see how the mean absolute percentage error (mape) changes when picking random periods of 1 to 10 years in length respectively from the history of a stock. We repeat this random selection 30 times.

We'll repeat the above process 10 times for GOOG which looks to be a more stable stock, and compare it with TSLA which appears to have more variability.


```python
%%time
random.seed(313)

symbol = 'GOOG'
symbol_data = get_symbol_data(symbol, start_date='2000-01-01')
symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})

mape_values = {k:list() for k in range(1,11)}
for i in range(30):
    for period in range(1, 11):
        # choose a random start; reserve at least 252*period at the end of the time series
        # 252 is roughly the length of a trading year in days
        start = random.choice(range(len(symbol_data.iloc[:-252*period])))
        mape_values[period].append(make_mape(symbol_data.iloc[start:start+252*period], n_in=19, n_out=7))

for year in range(1,11):
    print('{:2} {:.3f}'.format(year, mean(mape_values[year])))
```

     1 0.030
     2 0.027
     3 0.024
     4 0.024
     5 0.021
     6 0.020
     7 0.022
     8 0.019
     9 0.016
    10 0.019
    CPU times: user 42.4 s, sys: 828 ms, total: 43.2 s
    Wall time: 5.42 s


For GOOG, the longer the better it seems. A 9 year period produces the best outcome, but of course this is a random simulation so with a different random seed, the outcome will likely be different. Let's look at another symbol, TSLA:


```python
%%time
random.seed(313)

symbol = 'TSLA'
symbol_data = get_symbol_data(symbol, start_date='2000-01-01')
symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})

mape_values = {k:list() for k in range(1,11)}
for i in range(30):
    for period in range(1, 11):
        # choose a random start; reserve at least 252*period at the end of the time series
        start = random.choice(range(len(symbol_data.iloc[:-252*period])))
        mape_values[period].append(make_mape(symbol_data.iloc[start:start+252*period], n_in=19, n_out=7))

for year in range(1,11):
    print('{:2} {:.3f}'.format(year, mean(mape_values[year])))
```

     1 0.043
     2 0.050
     3 0.046
     4 0.036
     5 0.051
     6 0.061
     7 0.052
     8 0.060
     9 0.064
    10 0.060
    CPU times: user 43.4 s, sys: 732 ms, total: 44.2 s
    Wall time: 5.53 s


For TSLA more history data tends to amplify the prediction error, sustaining the idea of TSLA containing more randomness than GOOG, thus being harder to predict.

Let's repeat the above randomised model evaluation by selecting a sample of 10 arbitrary stocks:


```python
random.seed(313)
symbols = random.sample(symbols_data['Symbol'].to_list(), 10)
print(symbols)
```

    ['RDWR', 'ARGX', 'FLNG', 'VALN', 'ALHC', 'BBL', 'LII', 'FANG', 'INFO', 'FOCS']



```python
%%time

symbols_mape_values = {}
for symbol in symbols:
    symbol_data = get_symbol_data(symbol, start_date='2000-01-01')
    symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})

    mape_values = {k:list() for k in range(1,11)}
    for i in range(30):
        for period in range(1, 11):
            try:
                # choose a random start; reserve at least 252*period at the end of the time series
                start = random.choice(range(len(symbol_data.iloc[:-252*period])))
                mape_values[period].append(make_mape(symbol_data.iloc[start:start+252*period], n_in=20, n_out=7))
            except:
                continue
    symbols_mape_values[symbol] = mape_values

yearly_error_means = { k:list() for k in range(1,11) }
for symbol in symbols:
    print('{:6}'.format(symbol), end='')
    for k in mape_values:
        try:
            print('{:.3f}  '.format(mean(symbols_mape_values[symbol][k])), end='')
            yearly_error_means[k].append(mean(symbols_mape_values[symbol][k]))
        except:

    print()

The average error per year for the combine 10 stocks above:


```python
print('{:6}'.format('ymean'), end='')
for y in range(1, 11):
    print('{:.3f}  '.format(mean(yearly_error_means[y])), end='')
```

    ymean 0.043  0.035  0.032  0.031  0.034  0.035  0.034  0.036  0.027  0.026  

The data above provides further evidence that a group of stocks may start capturing market trend data. In this context, more data tend to fare better. In our sample above, using data from the last 10 years produced the lowest absolute percentage error at 2.6%.

### Final Justification

#### Test (almost) all the data

"Almost" refers to the fact that we only use data for the 34% of Nasdaq companies that make up more than 98% of the total Nasdaq market value.

For this section we downloaded all available data from Yahoo Finance for all the stocks having a market valuation of $1bn or more. This takes a considerable amont of time, close to 3 hours, so it is difficult to replicate, but we feel it is worth presenting the results nevertheless, to bring a final justification to our model selection.

The code to download the respective data is (uncomment it and run it replicate the results below):


```python
# %%time
# for symbol in symbols_data['Symbol']:
#     get_symbol_data(symbol, start_date='1900-01-01')
```

Next, for each stock symbol we pick an arbitrary start training period of 1 to 10 years (if it exists), fit a linear model and calculate the mean absolute percentage error for predicting 7 days in advance the stock's adjusted close value. We repeat this random proces 10 times for each stock. Then, we average the errors for each period of 1 to 10 years and present the results.


```python
%%time

random.seed(313)

all_symbols_mape_values = {}
for symbol in symbols_data['Symbol'].to_list():
    try:
        symbol_filename = 'data/{0}.pickle'.format(symbol)
        symbol_data = pickle.load(open(symbol_filename, 'rb'))
    except:
        continue
        
    symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})

    mape_values = { k:list() for k in range(1,11) }
    for period in range(1, 11):
        try:
            # choose a random start; reserve at least 252*period at the end of the time series
            start = random.choice(range(len(symbol_data.iloc[:-252*period])))
            mape_values[period].append(make_mape(symbol_data.iloc[start:start+252*period], n_in=20, n_out=7))
        except:
            continue
    all_symbols_mape_values[symbol] = mape_values
```

    CPU times: user 48min 27s, sys: 55.7 s, total: 49min 23s
    Wall time: 6min 11s



```python
# calculate the average error per year
yearly_error_means = { k:list() for k in range(1,11) }
for symbol in symbols_data['Symbol'].to_list():
    # print('{:6}'.format(symbol), end='')
    for k in range(1, 11):
        try:
            # print('{:.3f}  '.format(mean(all_symbols_mape_values[symbol][k])), end='')
            yearly_error_means[k].append(mean(all_symbols_mape_values[symbol][k]))
        except:
            continue

print('{:6}'.format('ymean'), end='')
for y in range(1, 11):
    print('{:.3f}  '.format(mean(yearly_error_means[y])), end='')
```

    ymean 0.048  0.044  0.038  0.037  0.037  0.035  0.035  0.034  0.034  0.033  

Working with the whole market data shows a clear trend: the longer the better. This observation is in accordance with the fact that the market has a long trend of increasing its value by about 10% per year.

There is a significant error decrease jumping from 1 to 2 years worth of data. After that there is progressive improvement but smaller and smaller as the history increases.

### Final Final Justification

#### Test (almost) all the data - again, but in a different way

One last test is presented below: for each stock and using the most recent data, we train and predict 7 values in "future" (really the last 7 ac values in our data sets) using 1, 2, and up to 10 years of the most recent historic data. We than average the results per year and display the results.


```python
%%time

all_symbols_mape_values = {}
for symbol in symbols_data['Symbol'].to_list():
    try:
        symbol_filename = 'data/{0}.pickle'.format(symbol)
        symbol_data = pickle.load(open(symbol_filename, 'rb'))
    except:
        continue
        
    symbol_data = symbol_data.rename(columns={'High':'h', 'Low':'l', 'Open':'o', 'Close':'c', 'Volume':'v', 'Adj Close':'ac'})

    mape_values = { k:list() for k in range(1,11) }
    for period in range(1, 11):
        try:
            # choose a start moment 1, 2, ... 10 years back from the current moment
            start = -252*period
            mape_values[period].append(make_mape(symbol_data.iloc[start:], n_in=20, n_out=7))
        except:
            continue
    all_symbols_mape_values[symbol] = mape_values
```

    CPU times: user 1h 4min 12s, sys: 1min 13s, total: 1h 5min 25s
    Wall time: 8min 11s



```python
yearly_error_means = { k:list() for k in range(1,11) }
for symbol in symbols_data['Symbol'].to_list():
    # print('{:6}'.format(symbol), end='')
    for k in range(1, 11):
        try:
            # print('{:.3f}  '.format(mean(all_symbols_mape_values[symbol][k])), end='')
            yearly_error_means[k].append(mean(all_symbols_mape_values[symbol][k]))
        except:
            continue

print('{:6}'.format('ymean'), end='')
for y in range(1, 11):
    print('{:.3f}  '.format(mean(yearly_error_means[y])), end='')
```

    ymean 0.054  0.049  0.049  0.048  0.048  0.048  0.048  0.048  0.048  0.048  

Again, working with most of the market data shows a good improvement after the first year, and practically reaching a flat plateau immediately after, but still showing a trend of slight improvement with more history used for training. 

Arguably, it is not worth training on a data set longer than two years and definitely no longer than 3 or 4 years. This is also in good accordance with our previous randomised test above (the section Final Justification). 

What is really surprising is that the average 7 days prediction absolute percentage error is exactly just under 5% - coinciding with the objective of this homework. Could this maybe be a systemic property of the stock market when aproached with simple analisys tools?

## Conclusion

We have shown that on average, the Nasdaq stock market can be predicted with a simple linear model which learns from the past 20 values of the Adjusted Close metric.

An average of under 5% absolute percentage error can be expected by predicting the next 7 days Adjusted Close values using at leat one year of history data.

This work also hints that significantly improving the 5% error margin, to say, below 3% is out of reach using the method above.

Where's money there is skewness and we saw this as well here, by noticing that about a third of the listed Nasdaq stocks make practically the whole marked with over 98% of the total Nasdaq market value.

## Reflection

I worked for a significant number of years in the finance industry and I was quite intrigued by this theme as a Capstone Project. I knew stock prices are hard to predict and I was asking myself: "is 5% on average for the next 7 trading days" a hard task? Or even achievable with desktop tools?

It turns out it is achievable.

I did quite a number of experiments while developing this post. I saw for example, that, except for TSLA and NVDA the top 10 symbols by Market Cap fare pretty well with the linear model, staying under 5% MAPE for well over 7 steps in advance (at least 20). I run the [Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) on different symbols trying to figure out why some are more linearly predictable than others - and could not extract any useful information. 

In running various tests on different symbols with lag steps ahead and behind, I was thinking that this is perhaps exactly what a decision tree algorithm would do if the data would be engineered in the right way. In doing these tests I also tried to figure out what is the statistical significance of these tests and step by step I realised that testing (almost) the whole market is within reach and would provide a solid justification for a selected model.

## Refinement

There are a number of ways to explore improvements with the approach above.

One way is to explore other features. The Volume field looks worth exploring since it seems to have little correlation with Adjusted Close thus possibly embedding additional information. Adding lagged values for Volume would be interesting to explore.

Another area is to compute metrics used in the established time series analysis field, and use them as new features.

Yet another set of features may be derived from the type of (a trading) day - maybe trading is done different at the end of financial quartes or in the proximity of holidays. The fastai library has such functionality which is presented [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/09_tabular.ipynb)

Last but not least, it would be interesting to find out how this approach fares when compared to a classic time series analysis aproach using libraries like [TSA](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/tsa.html) or [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html).
